                            One of the best things that you will find here is an amazing peer group. The training and placement cell keeps you well informed about the various opportunities available. The teachers are helpful and easy to approach. We have projects every semester which helps to develop critical thinking. We also get ample amount of time in between semesters to pursue our own projects, internships, and hobbies. All these things helped me improve myself and secure a great job at Lowe's India in 3rd year itself even in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

                            I have taken part in National and International competitions in and outside India. The college has been very supportive to provide me with technical help from experienced faculties as well as financial aids to develop projects and cover travel costs. These achievements and experiences really helped me stand out among others. The internship program differentiates IIIT Nagpur from other educational institutions, also, this has been one of the reasons why I chose to take admission in this college. The extra co-curricular activities including Technical and Cultural fests, Annual day, Entrepreneurship activities has helped me grow as a personality. I am proud IIITian to be part of the pioneer batch of such a prestigious institution.

                            The best part about IIIT NAGPUR is the kind of peers you get here. The people here are from diverse backgrounds and interest from which you can learn a lot. Be it coding, robotics, AR or any other thing, you will find students who are interested in them and doing something good in that field. This helps you to get in touch with like-minded and learn from them. The seniors as well as juniors are helpful and amazing.

                            I feel that being in an institute of national importance is a matter of pride and IIIT, Nagpur has always bolstered my opinion. From the provision of opportunities of the highest level to the students, to a robust and transparent administrative structure to the resence of faculties with a multifarious march towards teaching with regards to industry level teaching and research approaches, iIITN has got all bases covered. The perenially available and efficient Training and Placement Cell (TnP) does an impeccable task of exposing the students to world class facilities like webinars and brings in fantastic job as well as internship opportunities that are instantiated by the superb placement record. In my personal journey, being it of a research intern at IIT, Kharagpur and IIT, Gandhinagar or being a Ginesberg Ingermann Research Intern at BGU, Negev, Israel, the placement cell has been quite flexible buttressed suitably by the decisive coterie at the helm of affairs of the institute. I am happy to report that universities like the Oxford University relax their admission requirements for students of Institutes of National Importance and IIITN has always been a true reflector of the requisite values and I feel blessed to have been offered PhD seats from distinguished professors in top universities around the world by the virtue of this IIITian tag, cherishing my rigid attention to integrity.

                            I joined this institute when it was just a year old and to be frank was sort-of skeptical about how my further studies will take shape here. Since then, three years have gone by at a lightning speed - learning and enhancing all round skills with focus on getting ready for a professional career. It's been a wonderful and enjoyable experience, all along. Variety of courses are available & are designed keeping in mind the peculiar requirements of tomorrows IT world. The focus of studies here is clearly on IT industrs asks over a couple of decades and the institute makes every attempt to equip us in taking newer challenges in the professional world. Professors here make sure that along with the guidance for the curriculum courses they get you in the habit of self-studies and encourage you to hone your skills in the areas that you would want to specialize in. It allows you to develop your thought process in a divergent manner laced with in-depth thinking. If you think, this is only the place for studious and serious students you are completely off-track. The studies and fun go hand in hand here. We celebrate every national festival, seminars from industry experts, our popular national level college festivals " Tantrafiesta & Abhivyakti, hackathons, mock placement drives, etc. throughout the year and yet everyone stays steadfast on their exams and excelling their CGPA."The semester long internship program and in-house internships are an icing on the cake as it makes you industry ready and adds a good amount of experience to your bag before moving out to the industrial world. Institute is getting ready to relocate into a bigger and impressive campus soon and that will enable it to start additional courses and more intake of students. Now I am a year away to move out of this institute and surely, I can pat myself for making the right decision of joining here for my graduation studies.

                Hi! I'm Ankit Barai, class of 2021, B.Tech(CSE) at IIITN. I've enjoyed, learnt and achieved a lot during my three years at IIITN. I've completed Internships at IIT Kgp, IISc and Reliance Jio. The kind of exposure given by the faculty to the students is extraordinary. My recent achievement is that my team entered the finale of Covid19 Hackathon by CDAC,Nvidia and Govt. of India. I wish to thank faculties,staff and all my peers at IIITN for giving a shape to whatever I'm today.

Pre-placement talk was also organized before the selection process. Overall it was well organized and the selection procedure flow was crystal clear. I would also like to extend my gratitude towards Director, Dean and Harshad Panse Sir (TPO) for bringing this opportunity for students.
